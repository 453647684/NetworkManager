	* README
		- Update with some comments on theory of operation

2004-08-12  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/passphrase.glade
		- Set window title to " "

	* panel-applet/Makefile.am
	  panel-applet/keyring.png
		- Deliver to correct place

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Add comments
		- Remove applet->have_active_device as its no longer used
		- (nmwa_load_theme): load keyring.png too
		- (error_dialog): remove
		- (show_warning_dialog): subsume functionality of error dialog too
		- (nmwa_destroy, nmwa_new): create and dispose of an application-wide GConfClient
		- (nmwa_handle_network_choice): add to deal with user clicking on an item from
			the networks menu
		- (nmwa_menu_item_activated): GtkMenuItem "activate" signal handler
		- (nmwa_button_clicked, nmwa_setup_widgets): create and populate the menu on startup
			and when we get broadcasts of changed wireless access points only, not when the
			user clicks on the button to display the menu (too long of a wait)
		- (nmwa_add_menu_item): Make active network bold, and place a keyring icon beside
			networks that are encrypted
		- (nmwa_dispose_menu, nmwa_menu_item_data_free): dispose of the data we place on each
			menu item with g_object_set_data()

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- (nmwa_dbus_get_bool): add method to return boolean value from dbus message
		- (nmwa_dbus_get_active_network): add (nmwa_dbus_get_string() wrapper to get active network)
		- (nmwa_dbus_add_networks_to_menu): clean up, only show one instance of each ESSID in the menu
		- (nmwa_dbus_set_network): force NetworkManager to use a particular network for wireless cards
		- (nmwa_dbus_init, nmwa_dbus_filter): Trap network appear/disappear and device
			activation/deactivation signals and rebuild the menu when they happen

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- (main): use new nm_spawn_process() rather than system()

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_devices_handle_request): don't compare AP structure addresses directly, but essids
			instead.  Since we can now force best_aps to stick around, the AP structure to which
			dev->options.wireless.best_ap points to won't necessarily be in the device's device list
			if a scan has happened since the best_ap was frozen.  Also add "setNetwork" method
			to freeze the best_ap.

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): Use new nm_spawn_process() call rather than system()
		- (nm_device_*_best_ap): add freeze/unfreeze/get_frozen functions, and don't really update
			the best_ap in nm_device_update_best_ap() if the best_ap is frozen AND in the device's
			ap list

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.[ch]
		- (nm_spawn_process): add replacement for system() usage

2004-08-11  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Fix up copyright and credits to include Bastien and Eskil,
			who created the gnome-applets wireless applet, from whose
			skeleton this one was created
		- Rework nmwa_update_state()/nmwa_draw() so that state and which
			pixmap to draw is computed during nmwa_update_state()
		- Applet now shows itself all the time due to panel packing issues
			which caused the applet to previously never come back after hiding.
			When a wired device is the active device, the applet shows "not connected"

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- Clean up error messages and show what function they are from
		- nmwa_dbus_get_active_wireless_device()->nmwa_dbus_get_active_device()
		- Add new device type getters, and a status getter

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_devices_handle_request): Don't return an active network unless that
			network is actually in the device's ap list
		- (nm_dbus_nm_message_handler): Fix silly mistake returning status

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_update_best_ap): If the best AP is NULL, clear out the ESSID of the
			card

	* test/nmclienttest.c
		- Report status of NetworkManager too

2004-08-11  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.c:
		- (main): clean up Seth's code style

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c:
		- Use the more aptly-named path/service/interface constants from NetworkManager
		- Don't return empty strings ("") as object paths ever, instead return errors

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c:
		- Clean up Seth's code style

	* src/NetworkManager.[ch]
		- (nm_remove_device_from_list): remove anything having to do with pending_device
		- (main, nm_print_usage): change --daemon=[yes|no] -> --no-daemon

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- Move Iter struct right above the iter functions to preserve opacity
		- (nm_ap_list_remove_ap): implement
		- (nm_ap_list_update_network): deal with errors returned from nm_dbus_get_network_priority(),
			remove AP if NetworkManagerInfo doesn't know anything about it
		- (nm_ap_list_diff): user NMAPList iterators
		- (nm_ap_list_print_members): implement debugging function

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- (nm_dbus_nm_get_active_device): remove anything to do with pending_device
		- (nm_dbus_get_user_key_for_network): remove DBusPendingCall stuff (unused),
			and move the actual key setting stuff into NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_dbus_get_network_priority): return -1 now on errors
		- (nm_dbus_nmi_filter): fix strcmp() error that caused PreferredNetworkUpdate signals to
			get lost, and force the active device to update its "best" ap when AP lists change
		- (nm_dbus_nm_message_handler): Update conditions for returning "connecting" for a "status"
			method call due to pending_device member removal

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Move NMDevice structure to the top
		- Add a wireless scan mutex and a best_ap mutex to the Wireless Options structure
		- Remove Pending Action stuff from everywhere
		- (nm_device_activation_*): We now "begin" activation and start a thread to do the
			activation for us.  This thread blocks until all conditions for activation have
			been met (ie for wireless devices, we need a valid WEP key and a "best" ap), and
			then setup up the interface and runs dhclient.  We have to do this because there
			is no guaruntee how long dhclient takes, and while we are blocking on it, we cannot
			run our main loop and respond to dbus method calls or HAL device removals/inserts
		- (nm_device_set_user_key_for_network): Move logic here from NetworkManagerDbus.c so we
			can tell nm_device_activation_worker() that we've got a key
		- (nm_device_*_best_ap): lock access to best_ap member of Wireless Options structure
		- (nm_device_get_path_for_ap): dumb it down so the list doesn't lock against itself when
			diffing (AP appear/disappear signal functions make sure the AP is actually in the device's list)
		- (nm_device_update_best_ap): move logic from nm_wireless_is_ap_better() here

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Remove anything to do with pending_device
		- Adjust device activation to deal with activation-in-worker-thread

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.c
		- Clean up locking debugging a bit

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.[ch]
		- (nm_wireless_is_ap_better): remove, stick logic in nm_device_update_best_ap().  This function
			was badly named and is better as a device function

	* panel-applet/.cvsignore: add

			on a wired device.  Also never return an empty object path, instead return an error message

2004-08-06  Seth Nickell  <seth@gnome.org>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c: (nmwa_new):

	Check the error code when getting a connection.
	
	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c: (nmwa_dbus_init):

	Check if the NM service exists when initializing (rather than
	assuming it does not).
	
	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c: (nm_dbus_init):

	Don't acquire the well-known service name until we have
	registered object/path handlers and can actually receive
	calls.

			dbus in response to those differences

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- (nm_dbus_get_object_path_from_ap) New: given a device and an access point,

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Remove 'stamp' return functions
		- Treat returned user key as a passphrase and convert to a WEP key,
			but don't actually use the WEP key yet.  We use the returned user
			key as a hexadecimal WEP key until we can figure out a UI for
			passphrase-vs-hex key

	* src/NetworkManager.[ch]
		- Add missing <dbus/dbus.h> header
		- Move allowed_ap_list free functions to NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- Zero out NMData structure on free
		- No longer use a thread for allowed_ap_list updating, instead its now done
			through dbus queries against NetworkManagerInfo
		- Populate allowed_ap_list initially before adding existing network devices
			to the device list, so wireless devices can get their "best" AP

	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.h
		- nm_device_update_link_active(): revert changes for wireless link detection, the WEP-key-is-wrong
			logic is in device activation now
		- nm_device_activate(): for wireless devices, if we can't associate with access point (perhaps
			key is wrong) trigger get-user-key pending action
		- Implement get-user-key pending action stuff, tie to dbus messages
		- Rename nm_device_ap_list_get_ap() -> nm_device_ap_list_get_ap_by_index()
		- Add nm_device_ap_list_get_ap_by_essid()
		- Instead of copying "best" access points, ref them instead so that the key we set

	  		lists to NetworkManager by proxying user's GConf
	  

2004-07-15  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/Makefile.am
		- Turn on warnings

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- nm_create_device_and_add_to_list(): call nm_device_deactivate() rather
			that doing the deactivation ourselves
		- Cancel an pending actions on a device if its being removed
		- Break up link state checking a bit, make non-active wireless cards
			deactivated to save power
		- Remove unused variables

	* src/NetworkManager.h
		- Add support for "pending" device

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.h
	  src/NetworkManagerAP.c
		- Add support for determining whether and AP has encryption enabled or not

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.h
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Add signal NeedKeyForNetwork, method SetKeyForNetwork (testing only)
		- Changes for AP address from struct ether_addr->string

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.h
	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.c

		- Clean up explicit testing of dev->iface_type to use nm_device_is_wireless()
		- Update wireless link checking to try to determine if the AP we are associated
			with is correct, but the WEP key we are using is just wrong.  If its wrong,
			trigger the GetUserKey pending action on the device
		- If dhclient can't get an IP address, it brings the device down.  Bring it back
			up in that case, otherwise we can't scan or link-check on it
		- Add IP address change notifications at appropriate points (still needs some work)
		- Add nm_device_need_ap_switch(), checks whether we need to switch access points or not

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.h
