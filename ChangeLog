	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Force wireless cards into Infrastructure mode before we use them

2004-10-12 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* TODO
		- Remove bit about static IP address support

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.c
		- (nm_spawn_process): Add some error reporting

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activation_configure_ip): hook up to the static config
			routines in the backends

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- (nm_system_device_update_config_info): use shvar.c routines to
			parse the config file iformation, not our own
		- (nm_system_device_setup_static_ip4_config): new function, based
			heavily on 'ifup' script and 'ipcalc' tool code.  Set up a device
			with a static IP address and gateway

	* src/backends/shvar.[ch]
		- Parser (filched from initscripts package) for ifcfg-* files

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerSystem.h
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerDebian.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerSlackware.c
		- Stub nm_system_device_update_config_info() and nm_system_device_setup_static_ip4_config()

2004-10-11 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* TODO
		- Remove bit about more robust AP diffing since I just implemented it

2004-10-11 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.c
		- (nm_ap_new, nm_ap_new_from_ap): Don't crash when we don't have
			enough RAM to allocate new AP structures, but return NULL instead

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- (nm_ap_list_is_empty): new function
		- (nm_ap_list_combine): new function, combine two access point lists
		- (nm_ap_list_copy_keys): new function, copy keys from one list
			into another

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Rename some functions to be clearer:
			nm_device_get_best_ap_frozen -> nm_device_is_best_ap_frozen
			nm_device_just_activated     -> nm_device_is_just_activated
			nm_device_activating         -> nm_device_is_activating
			nm_device_now_scanning       -> nm_device_is_scanning
		- Cache the last 4 scans so that the access point list is more stable.
			We combine the lastest two scans and use that as the AP list,
			and diff that combined list against the combination of the earliest
			two cached scans for the WirelessNetworkAppeared/Dissappeared signals

2004-10-08 John (J5) Palmieri <johnp@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NWManagerInfo.h
		- (struct NetworkManagerInfo): add shutdown_timeout GSource

	* info-daemon/NWManagerInfoDbus.c
		- (shutdown_callback): new function
		- (nmi_dbus_filter): Create a 30 second timeout until shutdown
			if NetworkManager goes away.  Kill the timeout
			if NetworkManager restarts before the 30 seconds
			are up.
		- (nmi_dbus_service_init): 
			- call gtk_main_quit if NetworkManager is not running
			- add filters to monitor dbus service creations and
				deletions

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- (nmwa_update_state): Hide notification icon if we are only
			showing one wired card and no wireless interfaces 
			(Red Hat Bug #134895)

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- (nmwa_dbus_filter): changed exit to gtk_main_quit ()

	* info-daemon/NWManagerInfo.c
		- (main): Terminated the notification_icon_cmd array with a NULL

2004-10-08  Hendrik Brandt  <hebra@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added de (German).

2004-10-08 Dan Williams <dcbw@redaht.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Be a bit more robust about link checking, ie make sure that
			the WEP key we were given actually has some data in it

>>>>>>> 1.127
2004-10-08 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.c (main):
		- Initialize GError object to NULL

2004-10-08 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- Die if NetworkManagerInfo dies, since it manages our lifetime

2004-10-08 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.[ch]
	  info-dameon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.[ch]
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoPassphraseDialog.[ch]
		- Preserve original label text in the passphrase dialog so that
			it actually gets updated with the new network name the next
			time around.  Previously, we were overwriting it so you'd get
			the wrong network name to enter a key for
		- Add a "Key Type" combo to the passphrase dialog, user selects
			encryption key type now, type is stored in GConf too
		- Adjust NM<->NMI DBUS protocol to pass the key type back to NM too

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- Remove all the encyption method magic.  It's now set by the user
			and NetworkManager retrieves the type of encryption key from
			NetworkManagerInfo

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- Adjust to new way of setting encryption key and method
		- Pull encryption method down from NMI along with key

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Removed encryption method fallback magic as the method is now
			determined by the user.  This greatly simplifies the connection
			logic.
		- More robust connection/link logic.  Besides removing the encryption
			method fallback magic, check whether or not the card is receiving
			invalidly encrypted packets, which usually indicates that we have
			a bad WEP key set.
		- Don't blindly forge ahead when DHCP fails (still not completely fixed)

	* test/nminfotest.c
		- Test out new "Key Type" stuff in the NMI passphrase dialog

2004-10-07 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.conf

		- Add a new status tag "scanning", which is set when there
			is no active network connection, but NetworkManager is
			looking for an access point to associate with

	* panel-applet/main.c
		- Cast the applet appropriately for gtk_widget_show_all ()

	* panel-applet/main.c: Add missing file

2004-10-04 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Add a slightly more robust method of determining if the WEP key
			is correct or not, by checking the WEP-discarded packet count
			on the card

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.c
		- (nmi_gconf_notify_callback): Fix GConf essid escaping, should
			un-escape values we pull out rather than escaping them

2004-09-15  John (J5) Palmieri <johnp@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.conf
		- Created a more robust security policy for the DBus service
			- everything is denied by default
			- root can own and send to the service
			- users logged in at the console can send to the service

2004-09-13  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_get_essid): use iw_get_basic_config() rather than
			iw_get_ext (SIOCGIWESSID) since prism54 cards don't like
			the latter

		- Start using NetworkDevice/WirelessNetwork structures in more places
		- Update for unified device/network forcing in NetworkManager

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- some code consolidation

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_nm_set_active_device): "setActiveDevice" now takes either one

		- Remove old unused code

2004-09-11  Martin Willemoes Hansen  <mwh@sysrq.dk>

	* configure.in: Added Danish (da) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-09-09  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

		- Don't clear out the best_ap for wireless devices when the link goes
			down, that's done elsewhere
		- Kill any dhcp daemons when cancelling device activation since they
			may be stuck waiting for a DHCP address, and since we're cancelling
			activation we don't care about that anymore

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Make sure to unref the device we ref earlier (we refed it to make sure
			it stuck around during device activation and such)
		- If we were going to change the best device, but its activating currently
			(and therefore the change didn't occur due to the check earlier)
			we mark the state changed to we come back to it later when device
			activation has canceled and its no longer activating

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- SIGKILL dhcp daemons rather than SIGTERM-ing them

2004-09-09  Bryan Clark  <clarkbw@cvs.gnome.org>

	* info-daemon/passphrase.glade: 
	set passphrase input to activates_default : True

	* examples/python/systray/network_tray.py
	(network_tray.sort_networks):

	Added support for having wireless always scanning

2004-09-09  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	NOTE: this commit changes the behavior of wireless devices in
	NetworkManager.  They are now up all the time, scanning all
	the time.  Only the active device has an IP address and routing
	information set up however.  Also, NetworkManager will no longer
	opportunistically switch wireless networks when a better one
	comes in range, it will remain associated with one wireless network
	until that one drops out.

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- On a WirelessNetworkUpdate signal from NMI, don't update
			the "best" AP

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_set_link_active): clear out the best ap for
			wireless devices when the link is set to FALSE
		- Scan on all wireless cards, all the time
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): split out the wireless card
			link-waiting code to a separate function
		- Keep wireless cards up even if device activation fails
		- Don't update the "best" ap as much

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Don't update the best ap when checking if its frozen,
			let link checking clear out a frozen best ap for us

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- Scan on all wireless cards, all the time

	* configure.in: Punjabi(pa) is added to po/.

2004-08-31  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Remove 'debug' extern global from all files since we now
		use syslog()

	* src/NetworkManager.[ch]
		- Break out routine that get the net.interface property from HAL,
			removing that logic from nm_create_device_and_add_to_list()
		- (nm_create_device_and_add_to_list): make this a bit more general so
			it doesn't do the talking to HAL.  Also add arguments to facilitate
			the create of test devices.
		- (nm_data_mark_state_changed): rename from nm_data_set_state_modified()
		- (nm_data_new, main, nm_print_usage): add new argument "--enable-test-devices"
			which makes NetworkManager listen for dbus commands to create test
			devices, which have no backing hardware.  Use when you're on a plane
			for example, and/or forgot your wireless card at home.  Test devices
			_cannot_ be created unless NM is started with --enable-test-devices.

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- New "getLinkActive" method for devices
		- New "setLinkActive" method for devices (only works on test devices)
		- New "createTestDevice" method on NetworkManager object to create a test
			device of a specified type (ie wired, wireless).  UDI is created from
			scratch, as is the interface name.  Only works when NM is started with
			--enable-test-devices switch.
		- New "removeTestDevice" method on NetworkManager object which removes a
			test device.  Only works when NM is started with --enable-test-devices

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Logic to facilitate test devices.  Add variables to NMDevice struct to indicate
			whether a device is a test device or not, and what its link status is.
		- Deal with test devices in most functions.  For those that work directly on hardware
			special-case test devices.
		- (nm_device_new): don't create a test device if test devices weren't enabled on the
			command-line.
		- (nm_device_update_link_active): split out logic for wired and wireless device link
			checking to separate functions to facilitate test device link checking.
		- (nm_device_set_enc_key): Since some drivers for wireless cards are daft and
			don't make a distinction between System Authentication and Encryption
			(namely Cisco aironet), we use Open System auth when setting a WEP key
			on the card.  We don't deal with Shared Key auth yet.
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): split the activation cancel check logic out into
			a separate routine nm_device_activation_cancel_if_needed()
		- (nm_device_activation_signal_cancel): rename from nm_device_activation_cancel()
		- (nm_device_fake_ap_list): Test wireless devices obviously cannot scan, so create
			a list of fake access points that they can "see"
		- (nm_device_is_test_device): return whether or not a device is a test device

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_policy_get_best_device): attempt to deal with wireless network selection,
			previously if you "locked"/forced NM to use a wireless device but then
			selected a wireless network for NM to use, it would switch to a wired device.
			So, if the active device is wireless and it has a "forced" best AP, use it
			if the "forced" best AP is still valid
		- (nm_state_modification_monitor): deal with NULL best devices, for example
			there were no usable network devices, or the last one was removed

	* src/backends/NetworkManager*.c
		- Deal with test devices, mostly just return success for operations like getting
			a DHCP address

	* test/nmtestdevices.c
		- Test tool to create/remove/link-switch test devices

2004-08-30  Bryan Clark  <clarkbw@cvs.gnome.org>

	* examples/python/NetworkManager.py: 
	added convience functions has_wired_device and has_wireless_device

	* examples/python/systray/network_tray.py: 
	cleaned up a bunch of cruft, added support for listing wireless
	networks just like the real applet.  This is probably all I'm
	going to work on this applet from now on.
	TODO: add support for actually changing networks and devices

	* examples/python/NetworkManager.py (NetworkManager.get_device): 
	changed "nm.networks" into a dict from a list so I can store all
	the cool information about networks in there

	* examples/python/systray/network_tray.py: 
	Added nice message when you try to run without running make first

	* examples/python/NetworkManager.py: 
	Bug fixes to the code so we get all the device information
	that we need in get_device()
	
	* examples/python/NMTester.py: 
	Fixed _print_device_list to print_device_list

2004-08-29  Seth Nickell  <seth@gnome.org>

	* configure.in:

	Actually properly setup the Debian backend in configure.
	
2004-08-29  Colin Walters  <walters@verbum.org>

	* test/nmclienttest.c (get_device_name, get_active_device): Return
	NULL.

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c (nm_system_device_stop_dhcp): Just

	(nm_data_free): Cast arg to GFunc.

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c: Need to include

	assignment in conditional.
	(nmwa_dbus_worker): Return NULL.

2004-08-29  Colin Walters  <walters@verbum.org>

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c (nm_dbus_get_network_timestamp): Return
	a GTimeVal instead of time_t.  This is easier to work with,
	since time_t may be a long or double, we don't know.

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.h: Update prototype.

2004-08-29  Colin Walters  <walters@verbum.org>

	* configure.in: Generate config.h.

	* configure.in: Dump dependency on OpenSSL; we can't
	use it since this package is GPL:
	http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/openssl-and-the-gpl.html
	Instead, check for libgcrypt, use it if available,
	otherwise use included MD5 code.

	* src/gnome-keyring-md5.h, src/gnome-keyring-md5.c:

		- Remove debugging code
		- Enable device switching from menus

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- Method for asking NM to switch devices

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Set dev->activating earlier, avoids race between
			the dbus signal of "DeviceActivating" and setting
			dev->activating (which is what NM's "status" method call
			looks at)

Thu Aug 26 2004 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Rework menu code to add devices to menu, and to show
			signal strength for each access point.  Code cleanups
			too.

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- Grab network devices from NetworkManager too
		- Grab quality information from NM for wireless networks

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- Add dbus methods for getting the HAL UDI from a device and
			for getting its base quality, if its wireless
		- Consolidate some functions (wireless network notifications,
			device notifications)
		- Add method for requesting NM to use a particular device

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Change for function consolidations from NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Implement active device locking and user-requested devices
			(ie, tell NM to use a particular device instead of the one
			it autochose)

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Add method for getting the base quality of a device, if its
			wireless
		- Grab device base quailty info from iwlib during scans

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Use a user-requested device rather than the auto-chosen device
			if we are told to

Thu Aug 26 15:12:36 2004  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am: add po as a supdir

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.h:

	Use a menu bar instead of a button for the main clickable
	thingy.
	
2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_set_enc_key): always set device to "open" mode instead of
			turning encryption off, because the Cisco driver doesn't associate
			with WEP-enabled access points unless we are in "open"

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- Don't try to defererence blank passphrases

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Rebuild the menu whenever a user clicks

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- (nmwa_udpate_state): Set panel icon to "wired" (for lack of better ones)
			when NM isn't around or when its not connected

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): Make sure to reset dev->activating if we get
			canceled.

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- (nmwa_dbus_get_bool, nmwa_dbus_get_network_encrypted): correct method name
			for getting encryption, and don't stop on "val" once we've gotten it
			from NetworkManager.  Short form:  encryption should now show up.

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Set ESSID on a gconf trusted network too when force-setting the wireless
			network to associate with

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/*
		- Rework the panel applet to do all DBUS communication in a separate
			thread

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.[ch]
		- Remove "get_next_priority" function

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.[ch]
		- Convert "priority" functions to "timestamp"

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- Add a "enc_method_good" member and accessors to an Access Point
			to signal when we've found the correct encryption method
			for an access point
		- Add a "timestamp" member and accessors, remove "priority" member
			and accessors (use timestamps instead)
		- Rename "wep_key"->"enc_key"
		- (nm_ap_get_enc_key_hashed): new, return the correct mangled key
			for a specified encryption method using the access points
			source encryption key/passphrase

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
		- When updating a network with dbus, grab timestamp now instead of
			priority

	* src/NetworkManagerDBus.[ch]
		- Add signal for "DeviceActivating"
		- Switch priority->timestamp

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Change references of "wep_key" -> "enc_key" or "key"
		- Signal DeviceActivating when starting activation
		- When activating a wireless device, if the access point we are connecting
			to is encrypted, and we have a source key, try to generate a mangled
			key and use that (ie, generate real WEP key from a passphrase)
		- Rework device activation to fallback to other encryption methods if
			a previous one didn't work (ie, try mangling a key as a 104-bit passphrase
			first, then if that doesn't work fall back to direct hex key).
		- (nm_device_update_best_ap): fix a deadlock, and use timestamps instead of
			priority.  We now prefer the latest access point used, rather than using
			a priority scheme
		- (nm_device_do_normal_scan): make the encryption method "unknown" on access
			points we've just discovered, and merge in correct info from the global
			access point lists

2004-08-25  Seth Nickell  <seth@gnome.org>

        Patch from Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org> for adding
	Debian support.

	(nm_system_device_stop_dhcp), (nm_system_device_flush_routes),
	(nm_system_device_flush_addresses), (nm_system_enable_loopback),
	(nm_system_delete_default_route),
	(nm_system_kill_all_dhcp_daemons), (nm_system_update_dns),
	(nm_system_load_device_modules):

	* src/NetworkManager.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerSystem.h
		- Implement preliminary Gentoo support, adding a
			nm_system_init function to the backend specification

	* configure.in
		- Distribution auto-detection, lowercase any user-fed
			distribution names

	* initscript/.cvsignore
	  initscript/Makefile.am
	  initscript/RedHat/Makefile.am
	  initscript/RedHat/NetworkManager
	  initscript/Gentoo/Makefile.am
	  initscript/Gentoo/NetworkManager
		- Refactored initscript code separately for each
			distribution

2004-08-23  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* configure.in
	  src/Makefile.am
	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
	  src/NetworkManager.c
	  src/NetworkManagerUtils.[ch]
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerSystem.h
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
		- Refactor system-specific code into separate backends for
			each distribution

2004-08-23  Dan Willemsen <dan@willemsen.us>

	* dispatcher-daemon/NetworkManagerDispatcher.c
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.[ch]
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoPassphraseDialog.c
	  src/NetworkManager.c

	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
	  src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c

	  src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- Used syslog functions for logging instead of NM_DEBUG_DISPLAY & fprintf

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Fixed usage wording for --no-daemon

2004-08-23  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Update our state every second to get more responsive panel icon
		- (nmwa_update_state): remove bogus applet->pix_state = PIX_WIRED that
			was causing our marching ants status blips to never move when
			looking for a wireless network

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activation_begin): return if activation has already begun
		- (nm_device_do_normal_scan): merge WEP key and priority from the
			trusted/preferred network into the device's access point when the
			scan list is processed

2004-08-23  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscript/NetworkManager
		- Use NMLaunchHelper rather than sleeping

	* initscript/NMLaunchHelper.c
	  Makefile.am
		- Add helper program that exits only when NM activates a device,
			or 10 seconds have passed, whichever happens first.  This
			stops the boot processes until we have a network connection,
			which NM can't do because it daemonizes and brings the connection
			up in the background.  Allows stuff like NFS to not die.

2004-08-20  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoPassphraseDialog.c
		- (nmi_passphrase_dialog_ok_clicked): when updating the wep key
			for a network, set the essid as well since it may not exist yet
		- (nmi_passphrase_dialog_init): don't star out the passphrase field,
			since WEP keys/passphrases are long and prone to entry-error

	* panel-applet/Makefile.am
	  panel-applet/wired.png
		- Add (pulled from system-config-network temporarily)

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Show wired picture when a wired connection is used
		- Rename wireless icon enums, adding WIRELESS

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activate_wireless): unset encryption before bringing
			down the card and setting the essid
		- (nm_device_activatin_worker): request a key from the user if the
			AP we are connecting to is encrypted but we don't have a key
			for it yet
		- (nm_device_set_user_key_for_network): fix missing '== 0' for a
			strcmp() that prevented a user-entered key from actually getting
			used

2004-08-16  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscript/NetworkManager
		- Check for /sbin/ip
		- Do sysctl magic that network service does
		- sleep 4s after start to allow network time to come up [hack]

	* src/Makefile.am
	  src/NMLoadModules
		- Load all network device kernel modules (hal doesn't know devices
			are ethernet until the module is loaded, and therefore we don't know)

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- (main): daemonize later, launch NMLoadModules to alert HAL of our
			network devices, and bring up the loopback device explicitly

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.[ch]
		- (nm_enable_loopback): new function

2004-08-13  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* configure.in
	  panel-applet/Makefile.am
		- Fix up cleanfiles and server_DATA/server_in_files

	* README
		- Update with some comments on theory of operation

	* CONTRIBUTING
	  Makefile.am
		- Add CONTRIBUTING

2004-08-12  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/passphrase.glade
		- Set window title to " "

	* panel-applet/Makefile.am
	  panel-applet/keyring.png
		- Deliver to correct place

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Add comments
		- Remove applet->have_active_device as its no longer used
		- (nmwa_load_theme): load keyring.png too
		- (error_dialog): remove
		- (show_warning_dialog): subsume functionality of error dialog too
		- (nmwa_destroy, nmwa_new): create and dispose of an application-wide GConfClient
		- (nmwa_handle_network_choice): add to deal with user clicking on an item from
			the networks menu
		- (nmwa_menu_item_activated): GtkMenuItem "activate" signal handler
		- (nmwa_button_clicked, nmwa_setup_widgets): create and populate the menu on startup
			and when we get broadcasts of changed wireless access points only, not when the
			user clicks on the button to display the menu (too long of a wait)
		- (nmwa_add_menu_item): Make active network bold, and place a keyring icon beside
			networks that are encrypted
		- (nmwa_dispose_menu, nmwa_menu_item_data_free): dispose of the data we place on each
			menu item with g_object_set_data()

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- (nmwa_dbus_get_bool): add method to return boolean value from dbus message
		- (nmwa_dbus_get_active_network): add (nmwa_dbus_get_string() wrapper to get active network)
		- (nmwa_dbus_add_networks_to_menu): clean up, only show one instance of each ESSID in the menu
		- (nmwa_dbus_set_network): force NetworkManager to use a particular network for wireless cards
		- (nmwa_dbus_init, nmwa_dbus_filter): Trap network appear/disappear and device
			activation/deactivation signals and rebuild the menu when they happen

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- (main): use new nm_spawn_process() rather than system()

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_devices_handle_request): don't compare AP structure addresses directly, but essids
			instead.  Since we can now force best_aps to stick around, the AP structure to which
			dev->options.wireless.best_ap points to won't necessarily be in the device's device list
			if a scan has happened since the best_ap was frozen.  Also add "setNetwork" method
			to freeze the best_ap.

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): Use new nm_spawn_process() call rather than system()
		- (nm_device_*_best_ap): add freeze/unfreeze/get_frozen functions, and don't really update
			the best_ap in nm_device_update_best_ap() if the best_ap is frozen AND in the device's
			ap list

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.[ch]
		- (nm_spawn_process): add replacement for system() usage

2004-08-11  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Fix up copyright and credits to include Bastien and Eskil,
			who created the gnome-applets wireless applet, from whose
			skeleton this one was created
		- Rework nmwa_update_state()/nmwa_draw() so that state and which
			pixmap to draw is computed during nmwa_update_state()
		- Applet now shows itself all the time due to panel packing issues
			which caused the applet to previously never come back after hiding.
			When a wired device is the active device, the applet shows "not connected"

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- Clean up error messages and show what function they are from
		- nmwa_dbus_get_active_wireless_device()->nmwa_dbus_get_active_device()
		- Add new device type getters, and a status getter

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_devices_handle_request): Don't return an active network unless that
			network is actually in the device's ap list
		- (nm_dbus_nm_message_handler): Fix silly mistake returning status

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_update_best_ap): If the best AP is NULL, clear out the ESSID of the
			card

	* test/nmclienttest.c
		- Report status of NetworkManager too

2004-08-11  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.c:
		- (main): clean up Seth's code style

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c:
		- Use the more aptly-named path/service/interface constants from NetworkManager
		- Don't return empty strings ("") as object paths ever, instead return errors

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c:
		- Clean up Seth's code style

	* src/NetworkManager.[ch]
		- (nm_remove_device_from_list): remove anything having to do with pending_device
		- (main, nm_print_usage): change --daemon=[yes|no] -> --no-daemon

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- Move Iter struct right above the iter functions to preserve opacity
		- (nm_ap_list_remove_ap): implement
		- (nm_ap_list_update_network): deal with errors returned from nm_dbus_get_network_priority(),
			remove AP if NetworkManagerInfo doesn't know anything about it
		- (nm_ap_list_diff): user NMAPList iterators
		- (nm_ap_list_print_members): implement debugging function

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- (nm_dbus_nm_get_active_device): remove anything to do with pending_device
		- (nm_dbus_get_user_key_for_network): remove DBusPendingCall stuff (unused),
			and move the actual key setting stuff into NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_dbus_get_network_priority): return -1 now on errors
		- (nm_dbus_nmi_filter): fix strcmp() error that caused PreferredNetworkUpdate signals to
			get lost, and force the active device to update its "best" ap when AP lists change
		- (nm_dbus_nm_message_handler): Update conditions for returning "connecting" for a "status"
			method call due to pending_device member removal

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Move NMDevice structure to the top
		- Add a wireless scan mutex and a best_ap mutex to the Wireless Options structure
		- Remove Pending Action stuff from everywhere
		- (nm_device_activation_*): We now "begin" activation and start a thread to do the
			activation for us.  This thread blocks until all conditions for activation have
			been met (ie for wireless devices, we need a valid WEP key and a "best" ap), and
			then setup up the interface and runs dhclient.  We have to do this because there
			is no guaruntee how long dhclient takes, and while we are blocking on it, we cannot
			run our main loop and respond to dbus method calls or HAL device removals/inserts
		- (nm_device_set_user_key_for_network): Move logic here from NetworkManagerDbus.c so we
			can tell nm_device_activation_worker() that we've got a key
		- (nm_device_*_best_ap): lock access to best_ap member of Wireless Options structure
		- (nm_device_get_path_for_ap): dumb it down so the list doesn't lock against itself when
			diffing (AP appear/disappear signal functions make sure the AP is actually in the device's list)

	* src/NetworkManager.[ch]
		- Add missing <dbus/dbus.h> header
		- Move allowed_ap_list free functions to NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- Zero out NMData structure on free
		- No longer use a thread for allowed_ap_list updating, instead its now done

		- Implement get-user-key pending action stuff, tie to dbus messages
		- Rename nm_device_ap_list_get_ap() -> nm_device_ap_list_get_ap_by_index()
		- Add nm_device_ap_list_get_ap_by_essid()
		- Instead of copying "best" access points, ref them instead so that the key we set
