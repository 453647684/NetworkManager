	* Makefile.am
	  Makefile.in
	  configure.in
	  dispatcher-daemon/Makefile.am
	  dispatcher-daemon/Makefile.in
	  dispatcher-daemon/NetworkManagerDispatcher.c
	  
	    Add a daemon that receives signals from NetworkManager
	  and will (eventually) call scripts in /etc/somewhere
	  when devices go up or down.
	
	* NetworkManager.c
	  NetworkManagerDbus.c
	  
	    Spacing cleanups.
	
	* NetworkManagerPolicy.c
	
	    - Rename nm_policy_switch_interface->nm_policy_switch_device
	    - nm_policy_switch_device():
				Use kill (pid) instead of system ("kill <pid>")
	    - nm_state_modification_monitor():
				Add wireless essid to output of debug statements
				Correct typo in device compare to switch or not (should be !=)
				Don't sleep after sending "no longer active" signal, was useless
