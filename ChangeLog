	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Add IPv4 address update for active device during link state check
		- Don't allow wireless cards to be powered up when they are not the
			active device

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.h
		- Add DBUS IPv4 address change signal
		- Add DBUS IPv4 address get method for devices

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Make setting the WEP key actually work
		- Move IP address get/set/update stuff here, per-device
		- Power down/bring down wireless device when deactivated
		- For scanning wireless devices, if first scan returned ENODATA, try again

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Only set the WEP key for an allowed access point if there is one.
			We were setting it to be blank if one wasn't specified.

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.h
	  src/NetworkManagerUtils.c
		- Move the IP address stuff to NetworkManagerDevice.c

	* dispatcher-daemon/NetworkManagerDispatcher.c
		- Add device IPv4 address change notification stuff

	* dispatcher-daemon/NetworkManagerDispatcher.c
		- A bit more descriptive state message
		- Don't segfault when reading directory

	* src/NetworkManager.h
		- Remove NMData desired_ap member, its now
			per-device rather than global

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Remove references to desired_ap
		- Move the allowed AP list refresh stuff into a thread

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.h
		- Each wireless device now has a "best ap"
		- Make device activate/deactivate functions per-device
		- Make wireless scanning per-device
		- Add IPv4 address discover functions, stub IPv6 ones
		- Move ethernet address validation functions to NetworkManagerUtils.c
		- Add wireless access point accessor function
		- Get/Set functions for "best ap"

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Move activate/deactivate stuff into NetworkManagerDevice.c, per-device
		- Deal with per-device "best ap" rather than data->desired_apa
		- Implement allowed access point worker thread
		- Add nm_policy_essid_is_allowed() function

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.c
	  src/NetworkManagerUtils.h
	  	- Add nm_ethernet_address_is_valid() function
		- Add IPv4/IPv6 address get functions

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
	  src/NetworkManagerWireless.h
		- Move scanning stuff into NetworkManagerDevice.c, per-device

2004-06-29  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* dispatcher-daemon/NetworkManagerDispatcher.c
		- Implement script callout functionality

2004-06-24  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* NetworkManager.c
	    - Spacing cleanups
	    - Flush device routes and ip addresses when added to the device list

	* NetworkManagerDbus.c
	    - Spacing cleanups
	    - Add missing returns in the two signal functions
	
	* NetworkManagerPolicy.c
	    - Spacing and variable cleanups

	* Makefile.am
	  Makefile.in
	  configure.in
	  dispatcher-daemon/Makefile.am
	  dispatcher-daemon/Makefile.in
	  dispatcher-daemon/NetworkManagerDispatcher.c
	    - Add a daemon that receives signals from NetworkManager
			and will (eventually) call scripts in /etc/somewhere
			when devices go up or down.
	
	* NetworkManager.c
	    - Spacing cleanups
	    - Flush device routes and ip addresses when added to the device list

	* NetworkManagerDbus.c
	    - Spacing cleanups
	    - Add missing returns in the two signal functions
	
	* NetworkManagerPolicy.c
	    - Spacing and variable cleanups
	    - Rename nm_policy_switch_interface->nm_policy_switch_device
	    - nm_policy_switch_device():
				Use kill (pid) instead of system ("kill <pid>")
	    - nm_state_modification_monitor():
				Add wireless essid to output of debug statements
				Correct typo in device compare to switch or not (should be !=)
				Don't sleep after sending "no longer active" signal, was useless
