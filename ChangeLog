	* NetworkManagerPolicy.c
	    - Spacing and variable cleanups
	    - Rename nm_policy_switch_interface->nm_policy_switch_device
	    - nm_policy_switch_device():
				Use kill (pid) instead of system ("kill <pid>")
	    - nm_state_modification_monitor():
				Add wireless essid to output of debug statements
				Correct typo in device compare to switch or not (should be !=)
				Don't sleep after sending "no longer active" signal, was useless
