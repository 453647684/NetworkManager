TODO items for NetworkManager
-----------------------------

Any of these items are of course fair game for anyone, patches are greatly welcome.  It also serves as a "what still needs to be done" list.

- Honor "cancelled" Wireless Networks

When a user cancels the request for a WEP key, NetworkManagerInfo returns "***cancelled***" as the WEP key, which we need to trap and honor.  One method to do this could be to add a boolean value 'invalid' to NMAccessPoint, and upon a cancel message set 'invalid' to TRUE.  NM would not attempt to associate with 'invalid' access points.  The 'invalid' marker would be cleared when the AP it was for had any value changed in GConf, or when the AP it was for went out of range.  This means more complicated logic in the wireless scanning, since we have to retain 'invalid' state across scans (the scanned AP list is destroyed every scan).


- Alert user of new Wireless Networks

This would again require preserving some state across wireless scans.  We may need to hold the last scan while doing another, and diff the two structures at the end.  We should also send DBUS signals onto the bus when wireless networks appear/disappear from a device.  This would allow the UI portion (NetworkManagerInfo) to pop up some notification, and possibly ask the user whether he/she wants to add new wireless networks to the "allowed network" list


- Allow user-chosen Wireless Networks

If the user decides to associate with one particular wireless network, via a wireless network applet or something, we need to temporarily suspend device switching until that wireless network drops out.  One way to do this might be a boolean value in the NMData structure that stops device switching, which would be cleared when the wireless network that the active_device is associated with disappears.


- Access Point link checking thresholds

Wireless link checking could be enhanced to check the signal strength of an access point and switch of the current access point a wireless card is associated with has dropped below say, 20%.
