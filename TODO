TODO items for NetworkManager
-----------------------------

Any of these items are of course fair game for anyone, patches are greatly
welcome.  It also serves as a "what still needs to be done" list.


- WPA Enterprise support

Support WPA Enterprise. 


- Access Point link checking thresholds

Wireless link checking could be enhanced to check the signal strength of an
access point and switch if the current access point a wireless card is
associated with has dropped below say, 20%.


- Gracefully recover from dbus dropouts

There is currently no logic to gracefully recover from a crashed/killed dbus.
There are dbus functions for notification when services come up and go away
that we could use here.  Note that when dbus dies, hal also dies at the moment.


- Support 40/64 bit passphrases

Allow user to enter passphrases and convert them to 40/64 bit WEP keys on the
fly.  Unfortunately, the algorithm for 40/64 bit passphrases is kind of messy.
