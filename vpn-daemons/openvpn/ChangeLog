	* vpn-daemons/openvpn/auth-dialog/main.c: Only request one password,
	  still use GnomeTwoPasswordDialog, gives all the functionality we need.
	  This should be unified between VPN implementations. Also I had to add
	  GConf support to see if a password is really needed for the connection
	  type. The configuraton line should be written to the auth-dialog by NM
	  and maybe even an impl_needs_passwd_dialog or similar should be added.
	  Patch will follow when healthy again.

	* vpn-daemons/openvpn/properties/nm-openvpn-dialog.glade: Updated GUI,
	  contains now everything needed to configure all three connection types

	* vpn-daemons/openvpn/properties/nm-openvpn.c: Added handling of all
	  three connection types.

	* vpn-daemons/openvpn/src/nm-openvpn-service-openvpn-helper.c: Use
	  different environment variables which are available for all connection
	  types, fixed the returned VPN gateway address. This was the remote IP
	  used in the VPN network, not the remote's real address. This prevented
	  it from working if VPN gateway was not in the same subnet since routes
	  were wrong.

	* vpn-daemons/openvpn/src/nm-openvpn-service.h
	  vpn-daemons/openvpn/src/nm-openvpn-service.c: Added support for
	  password and shared secret connection types. Reformatted to Gnu style.

	* vpn-daemons/openvpn/configure.in: Raised version to 0.2.0

	* vpn-daemons/openvpn/intltool-extract.in
	  vpn-daemons/openvpn/intltool-merge.in
	  vpn-daemons/openvpn/intltool-update.in:
	  Version from intltool 0.33, 0.34 won't work at the moment.
